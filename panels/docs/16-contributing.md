## Reporting bugs
If you find a bug in Filament, please report it by opening an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/issues/new/choose). Before opening an issue, please search the [existing issues](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to see if the bug has already been reported. 

Please make sure to include as much information as possible, including the version of Filament you are using, the version of PHP you are using, and any relevant error messages or stack traces, that will help us to reproduce the bug and fix it.

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.
