title: Fields
---

Field classes can be found in the `Filament\Form\Components` namespace.

Fields may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its name. The name of the field should correspond to a property on your Livewire component. You may use [Livewire's "dot syntax"](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/properties#binding-nested-data) to bind fields to nested properties such as arrays and Eloquent models.

```php
Field::make('name')
```

By default, the label of the field will be automatically determined based on its name. To override the field's label, you may use the `label()` method. Customizing the label in this way is useful if you wish to use a [translation string for localization](https://laravel.com/docs/localization#retrieving-translation-strings):

```php
Field::make('name')->label(__('fields.name'))
```

In the same way as labels, field IDs are also automatically determined based on their names. To override a field ID, use the `id()` method:

```php
Field::make('name')->id('name-field')
```

When fields fail validation, their label is used in the error message. To customize the label used in field error messages, use the `validationAttribute()` method:

```php
Field::make('name')->validationAttribute('full name')
```

Fields may have a default value. This will be filled if the [form's `fill()` method](building-forms#default-data) is called without any arguments. To define a default value, use the `default()` method:

```php
Field::make('name')->default('John')
```

Sometimes, you may wish to provide extra information for the user of the form. For this purpose, you may use helper messages and hints.

Help messages are displayed below the field. The `helpMessage()` method supports Markdown formatting:

```php
Field::make('name')->helpMessage('Your full name here, including any middle names.')
```

Hints can be used to display text adjacent to its label:

```php
Field::make('password')->hint('[Forgotten your password?](forgotten-password)')
```

The HTML of fields can be customized even further, by passing an array of `extraAttributes()`:

```php
Field::make('name')->extraAttributes(['step' => 10])
```

You may disable a field to prevent it from being edited:

```php
Field::make('name')->disabled()
```

Most fields will be autofocusable. Ideally, you should aim for the first significant field in your form to be autofocused for the best user experience.

```php
Field::make('name')->autofocus()
```

Many fields will also include a placeholder value for when it has no value. You may customize this using the `placeholder()` method:

```php
Field::make('name')->placeholder('John Doe')
```

## Builder

Similar to a [repeater](#repeater), the builder component allows you to output a JSON array of repeated form components. Unlike the repeater, which only defines one form schema to repeat, the builder allows you to define different schema "blocks", which you can repeat in any order. This makes it useful for building more advanced array structures.

The primary use of the builder component is to build web page content using predefined blocks. The example below defines multiple blocks for different elements in the page content. On the frontend of your website, you could loop through each block in the JSON and format it how you wish.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        Builder\Block::make('heading')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('content')->required(),
                Select::make('level')
                    ->options([
                        'h1' => 'Heading 1',
                        'h2' => 'Heading 2',
                        'h3' => 'Heading 3',
                        'h4' => 'Heading 4',
                        'h5' => 'Heading 5',
                        'h6' => 'Heading 6',
                    ])
                    ->required(),
            ]),
        Builder\Block::make('paragraph')
            ->schema([
                MarkdownEditor::make('content')->required(),
            ]),
        Builder\Block::make('image')
            ->schema([
                FileUpload::make('url')
                    ->image()
                    ->required(),
                TextInput::make('alt')
                    ->label('Alt text')
                    ->required(),
            ]),
    ])
```

As evident in the above example, blocks can be defined within the `blocks()` method of the component. Blocks are `Builder\Block` objects, and require a unique name, and a component schema:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        Builder\Block::make('heading')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('content')->required(),
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

By default, the label of the block will be automatically determined based on its name. To override the block's label, you may use the `label()` method. Customizing the label in this way is useful if you wish to use a [translation string for localization](https://laravel.com/docs/localization#retrieving-translation-strings):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder\Block::make('heading')->label(__('blocks.heading'))
```

Blocks may also have an icon, which is displayed next to the label. The `icon()` method accepts the name of any Blade icon component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder\Block::make('heading')->icon('heroicon-o-archive')
```

## Checkbox

The checkbox component, similar to a [toggle](#toggle), allows you to interact a boolean value.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_admin'),
```

Checkbox fields have two layout modes, inline and stacked. By default, they are inline.

When the checkbox is inline, its label is adjacent to it:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_admin')->inline()
```

When the checkbox is stacked, its label is above it:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_admin')->stacked()
```

## Date-time picker

The date-time picker provides an interactive interface for selecting a date, and optionally a time.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
```

You may restrict the minimum and maximum date that can be selected with the picker. The `minDate()` and `maxDate()` methods accept a `DateTime` instance (e.g. Carbon), or a string:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->minDate(now()->subYears(150))
    ->maxDate(now())
```

You may customize the format of the field when it is saved in your database, using the `format()` method. This accepts a string date format, using [PHP date formatting tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')->format('d/m/Y')
```

You may also customize the display format of the field, separately from the format used when it is saved in your database. For this, use the `displayFormat()` method, which also accepts a string date format, using [PHP date formatting tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')->displayFormat('d/m/Y')
```

When using the time picker, you may disable the seconds input using the `withoutSeconds()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')->withoutSeconds()
```

In some countries, the first day of the week is not Monday. To customize the first day of the week in the date picker, use the `forms.components.date_time_picker.first_day_of_week` config option, or the `firstDayOfWeek()` method on the component. 0 to 7 are accepted values, with Monday as 1 and Sunday as 7 or 0:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')->firstDayOfWeek(7)
```

There are additionally convenient helper methods to set the first day of the week more semantically:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')->weekStartsOnMonday()
DateTimePicker::make('published_at')->weekStartsOnSunday()
```

## File upload

The file upload field is based on [Filepond](https://pqina.nl/filepond).

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment'),
```

By default, files will be uploaded publicly to your default storage disk.

To change the disk and directory that files are saved in, and their visibility, use the `disk()`, `directory()` and `visibility` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->disk('s3')
    ->directory('form-attachments')
    ->visibility('private')
```

You may restrict the types of files that may be uploaded using the `acceptedFileTypes()` method, and passing an array of MIME types. You may also use the `image()` method as shorthand to allow all image MIME types.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('document')->acceptedFileTypes(['application/pdf'])
FileUpload::make('image')->image()
```

## Hidden

## Markdown editor

## Multi-select

## Repeater

The repeater component allows you to output a JSON array of repeated form components.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')->required(),
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                'member' => 'Member',
                'administrator' => 'Administrator',
                'owner' => 'Owner',
            ])
            ->required(),
    ])
```

As evident in the above example, the component schema can be defined within the `schema()` method of the component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')->required(),
        // ...
    ])
```

If you wish to define a repeater with multiple schema blocks that can be repeated in any order, please use the [builder](#builder).

## Rich editor

## Select

## Tags input

## Text input

## Toggle

The toggle component, similar to a [checkbox](#checkbox), allows you to interact a boolean value.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
```

Toggle fields have two layout modes, inline and stacked. By default, they are inline.

When the toggle is inline, its label is adjacent to it:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')->inline()
```

When the toggle is stacked, its label is above it:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')->stacked()
```

Toggles may also use an "on icon" and an "off icon". These are displayed on its handle and could provide a greater indication to what your field represents. The parameter to each method must contain the name of a Blade icon component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->onIcon('heroicon-s-lightning-bolt'),
    ->offIcon('heroicon-s-user')
```
