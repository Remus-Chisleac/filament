## Eloquent Models 

All of Filament's database interactions rely on Eloquent. 
Filament's resources are static classes used to build CRUD interfaces for your Eloquent models. Therefore Filament uses Eloquent to get the data for its forms, tables, infolists, widgets. If your application needs to work with Collections or Arrays instead, you may find [Sushi](https://github.com/calebporzio/sushi) useful for presenting that data via Eloquent.
