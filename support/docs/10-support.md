If you are missing a channel for your language, please let us know and we will create one for you.

## GitHub (mostly free)

You can also reach out to us on our [GitHub community forum](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/discussions). Where our community members and maintainers are happy to help you out.

Of course, you are free to open an [issue](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/discussions/new/choose) if you find a bug or have a [feature request](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/support/contributing#development-of-new-features). If you don't want to wait, until a community member has addressed your issue, you can directly **fast track your issue** by [sponsoring](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament?sponsor=1) Filament or directly use the [funding](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afund) options provided on the issue page itself.

## Professional Support & Consulting (paid)

If you're looking for dedicated help with your Filament project, we're here for you. Whether you're a solo developer or running a large company, we provide support and development services that fit your needs.
More information can be found on our [consulting page](https://filamentphp.com/consulting).

## Laracasts 

[Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) has a dedicated [Filament help section](https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/filament) where you can ask questions and get help from their community.
Additionally on laracasts you can find two excellent courses about Filament:

- [Build Advanced Components for Filament](https://laracasts.com/series/build-advanced-components-for-filament) by the founder of Filament.
- [Rapid Laravel Apps With Filament](https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament)

> *An active subscription may be required to access these courses.

## Google

Since we make use of [AnswerOverflow](https://www.answeroverflow.com/c/883083792112300104), you are mainly one google search away from finding an answer to your question or at least a hint on how to solve your problem.

## Helping others

We would like to encourage you to join any of the above platforms and help yourself and our community out. Additionally, we would like to encourage you to [contribute](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/support/contributing) to Filament itself. We are always looking for new contributors to help us improve Filament.
