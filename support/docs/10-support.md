## Discord

If you are missing a channel for your language, please let us know and we will create one for you.

## GitHub (mostly free)

You can also reach out to us on our GitHub community section. We are always happy to help you with any questions you may have.

Of course, you are free to open an [issue](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/discussions/new/choose) if you find a bug or have a [feature request](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/support/contributing#development-of-new-features). If you don't want to wait, until a community member has addressed your issue, you can directly **fast track your issue** by [sponsoring]() Filament or directly use the [funding]() options provided on the issue page itself.

## Professional Support & Consulting (paid)

If you're looking for dedicated help with your Filament project, we're here for you. Whether you're a solo developer or running a large company, we provide support and development services that fit your needs.
More information can be found on our [consulting page](https://filamentphp.com/consulting).

## Laracasts 

[Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/) has a dedicated [Filament help section](https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/filament) where you can ask questions and get help from their community.

## Google

Since we make use of [AnswerOverflow](https://www.answeroverflow.com/c/883083792112300104), you are mainly one google search away from finding an answer to your question or at least a hint on how to solve your problem.
